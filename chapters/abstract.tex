The IEEE 802.11 standard was developed to connect devices together over a wireless local area, and it has evolved to be the most widely deployed WLAN technology. This standard contains protocols used to provide data confidentiality during transmission. While the standard protocols are secure in theory, traffic patterns leaked through side channels can be used to recover information about data being accessed online. 

This thesis presents a website fingerprinting attack on encrypted 802.11 frames and assesses a potential mitigation technique aimed at reducing the impact of side-channel attacks. Initial findings indicate that an attacker can successfully exploit information leakage using machine learning, highlighting how such leakage undermines the security that encryption intuitively should provide. Furthermore, this thesis evaluates a potential mitigation technique to decrease information leakage and illustrates that this technique has minimal impact on the attacker's accuracy.
