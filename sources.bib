abstract = {The comparative analysis of the renowned cryptographic algorithms AES, DES and RSA. The Rijndael algorithm was adapted as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, to Data Encryption algorithm (DES), which have been in the security standards since long time. The comparative analysis is implemented in IEEE 802.11i wireless platform. Compared to DES, AES contains CCMP which is a security standard that provides the highest level of security to encrypt and authenticate the data simultaneously. CCMP protocol is to provide robust security. The CCMP protocol is based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. It uses the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of operation. The CCM mode combines Counter (CTR) mode for privacy and Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) for authentication. The implementation is done on the NS-2 platform to compare and analyzes the performance of this with DES and RSA algorithms, based on the following three criteria: (a) Bit rate; (b) Packet delay; and (c) The number of packets. Thus the motivation is to provide a secure data transfer in the wireless medium in IEEE 802.11i.},
